# CoastSat-spit

## Basis
Since its appearance, the [`CoastSat`](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) toolbox has proven to be useful in research and management. Based on Python libraries for satellite image data acquisition and image classification, the software is capable of delinating shorelines. The original example included with CoastSat is for Narrabean beach (using file `example.py` and the folder `examples`)

## Site application
This toolbox has been applied to the case of Tien Chau inlet, Vietnam. The initialisation steps are similar to that of `CoastSat`, but Python functions have been added to calculate the morphology of the coastline. Specifically, the length and the orientation of the sand spit are calculated based on the classified images.
